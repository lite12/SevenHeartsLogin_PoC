# SevenHeartsLogin_PoC
Proof of concept of registration, authentication, session handling and examples of protection against SQL injection and brute-force attempts on the login. One page index, modular, front-end separated from back-end. Protections with PHP / MySQLi (or MariaDB).


Live demo verified working with PHP 7.2.0, 10.1.28-MariaDB (100% MySQL compatible).

Note short-tags should be "On" in php.ini and some of the PHP operators and "syntactic sugar" used is specific to PHP v7 and higher.
